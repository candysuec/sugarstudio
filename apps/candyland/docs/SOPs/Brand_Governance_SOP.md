# SOP-06: Brand_Governance_SOP.md

## 1. Purpose
To establish the framework by which the KniSoci AI maintains brand consistency across all generated content and strategic outputs.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all production-level modules within KniSoci, including content generation, consistency checking, and strategic planning.

## 3. Core Principles
1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The master Brand DNA, messaging matrix, and tone guidelines stored within KniSoci's database are the definitive source of truth.
2.  **AI as Guardian:** The KniSoci AI is the primary guardian of these standards. Its first responsibility is to ensure all outputs align with the established brand model.
3.  **Consistency First:** Creative expression is encouraged, but never at the expense of brand consistency.

## 4. Steps
1.  **Content Generation:**
    - Before generating any content, the KniSoci AI must first reference the core brand strategy (pillars, tone, audience).
    - The generated content is then passed through a consistency checker module.
2.  **Consistency Checker:**
    - The AI scores new content against the defined brand voice, tone, and vocabulary.
    - Content that scores below a predefined threshold (e.g., 85% match) is flagged for review or automatically revised.
3.  **Reviewing External Inputs:**
    - When reviewing experiments from Candyland or content from users, the KniSoci AI's primary filter is brand alignment.
    - It must identify deviations and suggest modifications to bring the content into compliance.

## 5. Validation Checklist
- [ ] All generated content includes a "Brand Consistency Score."
- [ ] The AI can explain *why* a piece of content is on- or off-brand.
- [ ] The brand governance rules are themselves version-controlled and updatable.

## 6. Responsible Parties
